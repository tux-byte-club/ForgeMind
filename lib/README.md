# JavaFX 24.0.2 - lib Directory

This directory is intended to hold the `lib` section of JavaFX 24.0.2.

## Steps to Set Up

1. Download JavaFX SDK 24.0.2 from the [official website](https://openjfx.io/).
2. Extract the contents of the `lib` folder from the downloaded archive.
3. Copy all files from the `lib` folder and paste them into this directory.

Now the required JavaFX libraries are ready to be used in your project.

*Note: Ensure that you have Java 17 or later installed, as JavaFX 24.0.2 requires it.*
